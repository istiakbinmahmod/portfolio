title: Blood Donation Website
img: "img/projects/02-blood.jpg"
description: We designed and developed a blood donation app as an undergraduate project. The website allows users to sign up as donors, specify their blood type, and provide their contact information. When a blood drive or a hospital requests blood, the app sends notifications to eligible donors in the area, allowing them to quickly and easily respond to the call for donation.
