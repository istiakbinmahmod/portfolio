description: We built a retro shooting game using C++ and the ATMEGA32 microcontroller. This game features 2D graphics, simple and fast-paced action, and a focus on high scores and player skill. The goal is usually to achieve the highest score possible, either by surviving for as long as possible or by collecting points for defeating enemies.
